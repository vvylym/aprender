## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the design and implementation of **production-ready** cold-start recommendation systems for the Aprender machine learning library. The focus is on techniques that require minimal or no training, leveraging existing primitives (TF-IDF, similarity metrics, graph algorithms, clustering, and Bayesian inference) with **approximate algorithms** to achieve sub-100ms latency at scale.

**Revised Key Objectives:**
- Zero-tolerance quality (95%+ test coverage, property-based tests)
- Cold-start capable (new users, new items)
- **Production scalability (<100ms latency for 1M items via approximate search)**
- Pure Rust implementation (no external ML dependencies)
- **Continuous improvement (Learning to Rank, Contextual Bandits)**
- **User-centric metrics (Serendipity, Coverage, LIME explainability)**

**Architectural Shift:**
- FROM: Exact algorithms (brute-force KNN, full graph construction)
- TO: Approximate algorithms (HNSW, LSH, sampled graphs, FP-Growth)

## 1. Content-Based Item Recommender

### 1.1 Overview

Content-based filtering recommends items similar to a target item based on feature similarity, particularly text descriptions. This approach is **training-free** and ideal for cold-start scenarios where user interaction data is unavailable [1, 2].

### 1.2 Algorithm (REVISED: Approximate Search)

**Toyota Way Critique:** Brute-force O(n×d) linear scan violates <100ms latency for n=1M items. Must use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search [11, 12].

**Input:**
- Item corpus: `{(item_id, description)}`
- Query item: `item_id`
- Top-k: `k`

**Process (Production Version):**
1. **Vectorization:** Transform item descriptions into TF-IDF vectors [3]
2. **Incremental IDF Updates:** Use exponential decay for streaming items to avoid hidden debt [15]
3. **Index Construction:** Build HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graph index [12]
4. **Approximate Search:** Query HNSW graph for k-nearest neighbors (O(log n))
5. **Ranking:** Return top-k items with highest similarity scores

**HNSW Algorithm:**
- Build a multi-layer graph where each layer is a navigable small-world network
- Top layer: Sparse long-range connections
- Bottom layer: Dense local connections
- Search: Navigate from top to bottom, greedy beam search at each layer

**Complexity (HNSW):**
- Indexing: `O(n × log n × d)` where n = items, d = vector dimension
- Query: `O(log n × d)` **[Meets <100ms requirement]**
- Memory: `O(n × M)` where M = max connections per node (typically M=16-32)

**Alternative: LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing):**
- Use random projections to hash similar vectors to same buckets [11]
- Query time: `O(k × d)` where k = bucket size
- Trade-off: Faster indexing, slightly lower recall than HNSW

### 1.3 Implementation (REVISED: HNSW Index)

```rust
// src/recommend/content_based.rs
use crate::index::hnsw::HNSWIndex;  // NEW: Approximate search index

/// Content-based recommender using TF-IDF and HNSW approximate search.
///
/// Recommends items similar to a target item based on text descriptions.
/// Uses HNSW graph index for O(log n) query time [12].

pub struct ContentRecommender {
    /// HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor search
    hnsw_index: HNSWIndex<f64>,
    /// Item identifiers
    item_ids: Vec<String>,
    /// Reverse index: item_id -> vector index
    item_index: HashMap<String, usize>,
    /// Incremental IDF tracker for streaming updates [15]
    idf_tracker: IncrementalIDF,
}

impl ContentRecommender {
    /// Create new recommender from item descriptions.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `items` - List of (item_id, description) tuples
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```
    /// use aprender::recommend::ContentRecommender;
    ///
    /// let items = vec![
    ///     ("item-1", "Red running shoes, lightweight"),
    ///     ("item-2", "Blue running shoes, cushioned"),
    ///     ("item-3", "Black dress shoes, leather"),
    /// ];
    ///
    /// let recommender = ContentRecommender::new(&items);
    /// ```
    pub fn new(items: &[(String, String)]) -> Result<Self, AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend k most similar items to target item.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `item_id` - Target item identifier
    /// * `k` - Number of recommendations
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// List of (item_id, similarity_score) tuples, sorted by score descending
    ///
    /// # Examples
    /// ```
    /// let recommendations = recommender.recommend("item-1", 5)?;
    /// assert!(recommendations[0].1 >= recommendations[1].1); // Sorted
    /// ```
    pub fn recommend(&self, item_id: &str, k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;

    /// Batch recommend for multiple query items.
    ///
    /// Efficient when recommending for many items simultaneously.
    pub fn batch_recommend(&self, item_ids: &[String], k: usize) -> Result<Vec<Vec<(String, f64)>>, AprenderError>;
}
```

### 1.4 Use Cases

- **E-commerce:** "Customers who viewed this also viewed..."
- **Media:** Article/video recommendations based on content similarity
- **Product Discovery:** Similar products by description/tags

### 1.5 Advantages

✅ No training required - immediate deployment
✅ Explainable recommendations (feature overlap)
✅ Effective for new items (cold-start items)
✅ No user data required (privacy-preserving)
✅ Leverages existing TF-IDF + cosine similarity

### 1.6 Limitations

❌ Limited diversity (tends to recommend very similar items)
❌ No personalization without user features
❌ Requires good item descriptions
❌ Cannot discover unexpected interests

## 2. KNN-Based Hybrid Recommender

### 2.1 Overview

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) recommendation combines multiple feature types (numerical, categorical, text) to find similar items without explicit training [4]. The hybrid approach weights different feature spaces for improved recommendations.

### 2.2 Algorithm

**Input:**
- Item features: numerical (price, rating), categorical (category), text (description)
- Query item: `item_id`
- K neighbors: `k`
- Feature weights: `w = {w_numeric, w_text, w_categorical}`

**Distance Metric:**
```
distance(i, j) = w_text × (1 - cosine(text_i, text_j))
               + w_numeric × euclidean(numeric_i, numeric_j)
               + w_categorical × hamming(cat_i, cat_j)
```

**Process:**
1. Normalize all feature types
2. Compute weighted distance to all items
3. Return k nearest neighbors

**Complexity:** `O(n × d)` where n = items, d = total feature dimensions

### 2.3 Implementation

```rust
// src/recommend/knn_hybrid.rs

/// KNN-based hybrid recommender combining multiple feature types.
///
/// Supports numerical features, text features (TF-IDF), and categorical features
/// with configurable weighting [4].
pub struct KNNRecommender {
    /// Numerical features (normalized)
    numeric_features: Matrix<f32>,
    /// Text features (TF-IDF vectors)
    text_features: Vec<Vector<f64>>,
    /// Categorical features (one-hot encoded)
    categorical_features: Matrix<f32>,
    /// Item identifiers
    item_ids: Vec<String>,
    /// K neighbors
    k: usize,
    /// Feature weights (text, numeric, categorical)
    weights: (f64, f64, f64),
}

impl KNNRecommender {
    /// Create hybrid recommender with mixed features.
    pub fn new(
        items: DataFrame,
        text_descriptions: &[String],
        k: usize,
    ) -> Result<Self, AprenderError>;

    /// Set feature weights for distance computation.
    pub fn with_weights(mut self, text_weight: f64, numeric_weight: f64, categorical_weight: f64) -> Self;

    /// Recommend k nearest items by hybrid distance.
    pub fn recommend(&self, item_id: &str, top_n: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;
}
```

### 2.4 Use Cases

- **E-commerce:** Products with descriptions + price + category
- **Real Estate:** Properties with text + location + numerical features
- **Job Recommendations:** Job descriptions + salary + skills

## 3. Graph-Based Recommender

### 3.1 Overview

Graph-based recommendations model items as nodes and relationships (similarity, co-occurrence) as edges [5, 6]. Graph algorithms (PageRank, shortest paths, community detection) provide diverse recommendation strategies without training.

### 3.2 Algorithm

**Graph Construction:**
1. Nodes: Items
2. Edges: Add edge(i, j) if similarity(i, j) > threshold
3. Weights: Edge weight = similarity score

**Recommendation Strategies:**

**3.2.1 PageRank-based:**
- Start random walk from query item
- Compute PageRank scores
- Return top-k highest-ranked nodes [5]

**3.2.2 Shortest Path-based:**
- Compute shortest paths from query item
- Return k items with smallest path distance

**3.2.3 Community-based:**
- Detect communities (Louvain algorithm)
- Recommend items from same community

**Complexity:**
- Graph construction: `O(n² × d)` for dense similarity
- PageRank: `O(E × iterations)` where E = edges
- Shortest paths: `O(V log V + E)` (Dijkstra)

### 3.3 Implementation

```rust
// src/recommend/graph_based.rs

/// Graph-based recommender using network algorithms.
///
/// Models items as graph nodes with similarity edges [5, 6].
/// Supports multiple recommendation strategies via graph traversal.
pub struct GraphRecommender {
    /// Item similarity graph
    graph: Graph,
    /// Item ID to node index mapping
    item_to_node: HashMap<String, usize>,
    /// Similarity threshold for edge creation
    threshold: f64,
}

impl GraphRecommender {
    /// Build item graph from similarity matrix.
    pub fn new(items: &[Item], threshold: f64) -> Result<Self, AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend via PageRank random walk.
    pub fn recommend_by_pagerank(&self, item_id: &str, k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend via shortest path distance.
    pub fn recommend_by_path(&self, item_id: &str, k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend via community detection.
    pub fn recommend_by_community(&self, item_id: &str, k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;
}
```

### 3.4 Use Cases

- **Product Networks:** Co-purchased item graphs
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Entity relationship traversal

## 4. Association Rules Recommender (REVISED: FP-Growth)

### 4.1 Overview

**Toyota Way Critique:** Apriori has exponential candidate generation O(2^k) and requires multiple database scans. This violates Jidoka (built-in quality) by allowing exponential blowup. Replace with FP-Growth [16].

Association rule mining discovers frequent item co-occurrences in transaction data. The FP-Growth algorithm identifies patterns like "customers who bought X also bought Y" with minimal training (just counting), using a compressed FP-tree structure to avoid candidate generation [16].

### 4.2 Algorithm (FP-Growth)

**Input:**
- Transaction database: `T = {t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ}` where each `tᵢ` is a set of items
- Min support: `min_sup`
- Min confidence: `min_conf`

**FP-Growth Process:**
1. **Frequency Counting:** Scan database once to count item frequencies
2. **FP-Tree Construction:** Build compressed frequent-pattern tree
   - Sort items by frequency (descending)
   - Insert transactions into tree, sharing prefixes
   - Each node stores (item, count, parent link)
3. **Conditional Pattern Base:** For each item, extract conditional patterns
4. **Recursive Mining:** Build conditional FP-trees and mine recursively
5. **Rule Generation:** Generate rules with confidence ≥ `min_conf`

**Advantages over Apriori:**
- ✅ Single database scan (Apriori requires multiple)
- ✅ No candidate generation (Apriori generates 2^k candidates)
- ✅ Memory-efficient tree compression
- ✅ Faster for dense datasets

**Metrics:**
- Support: `P(X ∪ Y) = count(X ∪ Y) / total_transactions`
- Confidence: `P(Y | X) = P(X ∪ Y) / P(X)`
- Lift: `P(Y | X) / P(Y)` (measures dependency strength)

**Complexity (FP-Growth):**
- Tree construction: `O(n × ℓ)` where n = transactions, ℓ = max transaction length
- Mining: `O(n × ℓ)` (linear in practice, no exponential candidate explosion)

### 4.3 Implementation (FP-Growth)

```rust
// src/recommend/association.rs
use crate::mining::fpgrowth::FPGrowth;  // NEW: Replace Apriori with FP-Growth

/// Market basket recommender using FP-Growth association rules.
///
/// Discovers "frequently bought together" patterns via FP-Growth [16].
/// Avoids exponential candidate generation of Apriori.
pub struct MarketBasketRecommender {
    /// FP-Tree for efficient pattern mining
    fp_tree: FPTree,
    /// Mined association rules
    rules: Vec<AssociationRule>,
    /// Item frequency counts
    item_support: HashMap<String, f64>,
}

impl MarketBasketRecommender {
    /// Mine association rules from transaction history.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `transactions` - List of item sets (shopping baskets)
    /// * `min_support` - Minimum support threshold (0.0-1.0)
    /// * `min_confidence` - Minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
    pub fn fit(
        &mut self,
        transactions: &[Vec<String>],
        min_support: f64,
        min_confidence: f64,
    ) -> Result<(), AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend items given current basket.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `basket` - Items currently in shopping cart
    /// * `k` - Number of recommendations
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Top-k items sorted by (confidence × lift)
    pub fn recommend(&self, basket: &[String], k: usize) -> Vec<(String, f64)>;

    /// Get all rules involving an item.
    pub fn get_rules_for_item(&self, item: &str) -> Vec<&AssociationRule>;
}
```

### 4.4 Use Cases

- **E-commerce:** "Frequently bought together" bundles
- **Grocery:** Shopping cart recommendations
- **Cross-selling:** Product bundle suggestions

## 5. Clustering-Based Recommender (REVISED: K-Means++)

### 5.1 Overview

**Toyota Way Critique:** Standard K-Means uses random initialization, causing flaky clusters (violates Jidoka). Mandate K-Means++ initialization for guaranteed O(log k) approximation [14].

Clustering groups similar items together, enabling fast "same-cluster" recommendations [8]. K-Means++ or DBSCAN can cluster items in minutes, providing instant recommendations within clusters.

### 5.2 Algorithm (K-Means++ Initialization)

**Toyota Way Fix:** K-Means++ chooses initial centers with probability proportional to distance squared from existing centers, ensuring high-quality initialization [14].

**Training Phase:**
1. Extract item feature vectors (TF-IDF, numerical features)
2. **K-Means++ Initialization:**
   - Choose first center uniformly at random
   - For each subsequent center:
     - Compute D(x) = distance to nearest existing center
     - Choose next center with probability ∝ D(x)²
3. Apply Lloyd's algorithm (standard K-Means iterations)
4. Store cluster assignments and centroids

**Alternative: DBSCAN (no initialization needed)**
- Density-based clustering discovers clusters automatically
- No need to specify k in advance
- Robust to outliers

**Recommendation Phase:**
1. Identify query item's cluster
2. Rank items within same cluster by distance to query
3. Return top-k items

**Complexity:**
- Training (K-Means++): `O(n × k × i × d)` where i is typically much smaller than random init
- Query: `O(c × d)` where c = avg cluster size
- **Quality:** K-Means++ guarantees O(log k) approximation to optimal

### 5.3 Implementation

```rust
// src/recommend/cluster_based.rs

/// Clustering-based recommender for fast same-category recommendations.
///
/// Pre-clusters items for O(c) query time where c = cluster size [8].
pub struct ClusterRecommender {
    /// Cluster assignments for each item
    clusters: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    /// Cluster centroids
    centroids: Vec<Vector<f32>>,
    /// Item features (for distance computation)
    item_features: Matrix<f32>,
    /// Item identifiers
    item_ids: Vec<String>,
}

impl ClusterRecommender {
    /// Cluster items using K-Means++ initialization (MANDATORY).
    ///
    /// # Quality Guarantee
    /// K-Means++ provides O(log k) approximation to optimal clustering [14].
    /// Random initialization is FORBIDDEN due to flaky quality (Jidoka violation).
    pub fn fit_kmeans_plusplus(
        &mut self,
        item_features: &Matrix<f32>,
        n_clusters: usize,
    ) -> Result<(), AprenderError>;

    /// Cluster items using DBSCAN (discovers clusters automatically).
    pub fn fit_dbscan(
        &mut self,
        item_features: &Matrix<f32>,
        eps: f32,
        min_samples: usize,
    ) -> Result<(), AprenderError>;

    /// Recommend items from same cluster.
    pub fn recommend(&self, item_id: &str, k: usize) -> Result<Vec<(String, f64)>, AprenderError>;

    /// Get cluster statistics (sizes, densities).
    pub fn cluster_stats(&self) -> Vec<ClusterStats>;
}
```

### 5.4 Use Cases

- **Category-Aware Recommendations:** Similar products within category
- **Pre-filtering:** Reduce search space before ranking
- **Scalability:** Fast recommendations for millions of items

## 6. Bayesian Popularity Recommender

### 6.1 Overview

Bayesian popularity ranking handles the cold-start problem for new items with few interactions [9]. By using prior distributions, items with small sample sizes are not unfairly penalized or promoted.

### 6.2 Algorithm

**Problem:** Ranking items by success rate (clicks/views, likes/total) is biased when sample sizes vary.

**Solution:** Bayesian estimation with Beta-Binomial conjugate prior [9]

**Model:**
- Prior: `Beta(α, β)` - represents prior belief about success rate
- Likelihood: `Binomial(n, θ)` - observed data
- Posterior: `Beta(α + successes, β + failures)`

**Ranking Metric:**
```
score(item) = (successes + α) / (total + α + β)
```

Where:
- `α = prior_successes` (e.g., 2)
- `β = prior_failures` (e.g., 2)
- Conservative priors shrink estimates toward 0.5

**Complexity:** `O(n)` - simple computation per item

### 6.3 Implementation

```rust
// src/recommend/bayesian_popularity.rs

/// Bayesian popularity recommender with cold-start handling.
///
/// Uses Beta-Binomial conjugate prior to smooth popularity estimates [9].
/// Prevents new items from dominating or being ignored due to small samples.
pub struct BayesianPopularityRecommender {
    /// Item statistics (views, clicks, likes, etc.)
    items: Vec<ItemStats>,
    /// Prior alpha (pseudo-successes)
    prior_alpha: f64,
    /// Prior beta (pseudo-failures)
    prior_beta: f64,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ItemStats {
    pub item_id: String,
    pub successes: usize,  // clicks, likes, purchases
    pub total: usize,      // views, impressions
}

impl BayesianPopularityRecommender {
    /// Create recommender with prior beliefs.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `prior_alpha` - Prior successes (typically 1-10)
    /// * `prior_beta` - Prior failures (typically 1-10)
    ///
    /// Conservative priors (α=β=2) shrink toward 50% baseline.
    pub fn new(prior_alpha: f64, prior_beta: f64) -> Self;

    /// Add item statistics.
    pub fn add_item(&mut self, item_id: String, successes: usize, total: usize);

    /// Recommend top-k items by Bayesian average.
    pub fn recommend(&self, k: usize) -> Vec<(String, f64)>;

    /// Get posterior distribution for item.
    pub fn get_posterior(&self, item_id: &str) -> Option<BetaDistribution>;

    /// Compute 95% credible interval for item's true rate.
    pub fn credible_interval(&self, item_id: &str) -> Option<(f64, f64)>;
}
```

### 6.4 Use Cases

- **Trending Items:** Rank popular items with statistical confidence
- **A/B Testing:** Winner selection with proper uncertainty quantification
- **Cold-Start Items:** Fair ranking for new products with few ratings

### 6.5 Example

```rust
let mut recommender = BayesianPopularityRecommender::new(2.0, 2.0);

// Item A: 100 successes / 100 views = 100% (but small sample)
recommender.add_item("item-a", 100, 100);

// Item B: 500 successes / 1000 views = 50% (large sample)
recommender.add_item("item-b", 500, 1000);

// Bayesian scores:
// Item A: (100 + 2) / (100 + 2 + 2) = 0.981
// Item B: (500 + 2) / (1000 + 2 + 2) = 0.500

// Item A ranked higher, but not 100% due to prior shrinkage
```

### 6.6 Upgrade: Contextual Bandits (Active Exploration)

**Toyota Way Critique:** Bayesian Popularity is passive - it only exploits current knowledge. It doesn't actively explore uncertain items to learn their true quality (violates Kaizen) [18].

**Solution: LinUCB (Linear Upper Confidence Bound)**

Contextual bandits balance **exploitation** (recommend known-good items) with **exploration** (test uncertain items to learn) [18].

**Algorithm:**
```
UCB_score(item, context) = θᵀ × context + α × √(contextᵀ × A⁻¹ × context)
                           \_____________/   \___________________________/
                           Predicted reward   Exploration bonus (uncertainty)
```

Where:
- `θ` = learned weight vector
- `context` = item features + user features
- `A` = covariance matrix (tracks uncertainty)
- `α` = exploration parameter (typically 0.1-2.0)

**Implementation Extension:**
```rust
// src/recommend/contextual_bandit.rs

/// Contextual Bandit recommender with active exploration [18].
///
/// # Toyota Way: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
/// Actively explores uncertain items to improve catalog knowledge.
pub struct ContextualBanditRecommender {
    /// Base Bayesian recommender
    bayesian: BayesianPopularityRecommender,
    /// LinUCB model for contextual recommendations
    linucb: LinUCB,
    /// Exploration parameter (α)
    alpha: f64,
}

impl ContextualBanditRecommender {
    /// Recommend with exploration/exploitation trade-off.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Top-k items with UCB scores (higher uncertainty = higher score during exploration)
    pub fn recommend(&self, user_context: &UserContext, k: usize) -> Vec<(String, f64)> {
        self.linucb.recommend_with_ucb(user_context, self.alpha, k)
    }

    /// Update model from observed reward (click, purchase).
    pub fn update(&mut self, item_id: &str, context: &Context, reward: f64) {
        self.linucb.update(item_id, context, reward);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Discovers hidden gems (low-rated items that might be great)
- ✅ Handles concept drift (item quality changes over time)
- ✅ Reduces echo chamber effect (diversifies recommendations)
- ✅ Provably optimal regret: O(√T) where T = time steps

## 7. Cold-Start Problem & Hybrid Strategies

### 7.1 Cold-Start Taxonomy

**Three Cold-Start Scenarios:**

1. **New User (User Cold-Start):**
   - No interaction history
   - **Solution:** Content-based, popularity-based, demographic filtering

2. **New Item (Item Cold-Start):**
   - No ratings/interactions yet
   - **Solution:** Content-based, attribute-based, Bayesian popularity

3. **New System (System Cold-Start):**
   - No users and no items have data
   - **Solution:** Editorial recommendations, trending from external sources

### 7.2 Hybrid Recommendation Strategy (REVISED: Learning to Rank)

**Toyota Way Critique:** Hardcoded weights (0.5, 0.3, 0.2) are fragile heuristics that violate Kaizen (continuous improvement). Different users need different weights. Replace with Learning to Rank [17].

Combine multiple methods using **LambdaRank** for adaptive weighting [10, 17]:

```rust
// src/recommend/hybrid.rs
use crate::rank::lambdarank::LambdaRanker;  // NEW: Learning to Rank

pub struct HybridRecommender {
    content_based: ContentRecommender,
    knn_hybrid: KNNRecommender,
    popularity: BayesianPopularityRecommender,
    /// Learning to Rank model (replaces static weights)
    ranker: LambdaRanker,
}

impl HybridRecommender {
    /// Learning to Rank hybrid: learns optimal score combination from clicks.
    ///
    /// # Toyota Way: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
    /// Ranker improves over time as users interact with recommendations [17].
    pub fn recommend(&self, item_id: &str, user_context: &UserContext, k: usize) -> Vec<(String, f64)> {
        let content_recs = self.content_based.recommend(item_id, k * 3);
        let knn_recs = self.knn_hybrid.recommend(item_id, k * 3);
        let pop_recs = self.popularity.recommend(k * 3);

        // Extract features for each candidate
        let candidates: Vec<RankFeatures> = self.merge_candidates(&[
            content_recs,
            knn_recs,
            pop_recs,
        ]);

        // Learn optimal ranking from user feedback (clicks, purchases)
        let ranked = self.ranker.rank(candidates, user_context);

        ranked.into_iter().take(k).collect()
    }

    /// Update ranker from user feedback (online learning).
    pub fn update_from_click(&mut self, item_id: &str, clicked: bool) {
        // Pairwise update: clicked items should rank higher
        self.ranker.update_pairwise(item_id, clicked);
    }
}

/// Features for Learning to Rank
struct RankFeatures {
    content_score: f64,
    knn_score: f64,
    popularity_score: f64,
    item_age_days: f64,
    category: String,
    // User-specific features
    user_history_overlap: f64,
}
```

**LambdaRank Algorithm [17]:**
- Optimizes directly for ranking metrics (NDCG, MAP)
- Uses gradient descent on pairwise loss
- Handles position bias (top items get more attention)
- Adapts weights per user/context

## 9. Evaluation Metrics

### 9.1 Ranking Metrics

**Precision@K:**
```
P@K = (# relevant items in top-K) / K
```

**Recall@K:**
```
R@K = (# relevant items in top-K) / (total # relevant items)
```

**Mean Average Precision (MAP):**
```
MAP = (1/|U|) × Σ_u AP(u)
where AP(u) = (1/|R_u|) × Σ_k P(k) × rel(k)
```

**Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K):**
```
DCG@K = Σ_i=1^K (2^rel_i - 1) / log₂(i + 1)
NDCG@K = DCG@K / IDCG@K
```

### 9.2 Diversity Metrics

**Intra-List Diversity:**
```
ILD = (1 / |L|(|L|-1)) × Σ_i Σ_j≠i (1 - similarity(i, j))
```

**Coverage:**
```
Coverage = |{items recommended}| / |{all items}|
```

### 9.3 User-Centric Metrics (Toyota Way: Respect for People)

**Toyota Way Critique:** Accuracy metrics (Precision, NDCG) don't capture user delight. "Being accurate is not enough" [19].

**Serendipity (Unexpectedness + Relevance):**
```
Serendipity@K = (1/K) × Σ_i=1^K unexpected(i) × relevant(i)

where:
  unexpected(i) = 1 - max(similarity(i, user_history))
  relevant(i) = user_rating(i) > threshold
```

**Explanation:** Recommending "obvious" items (similar to what user already likes) has zero serendipity. High-value serendipity = relevant BUT unexpected [19].

**Catalog Coverage (Long-Tail Discovery):**
```
Coverage_gini = 1 - (2 / (n-1)) × Σ_i=1^n (n - i + 0.5) × p_i

where:
  p_i = fraction of times item i was recommended (sorted)
  Gini = 0: perfect equality (all items recommended equally)
  Gini = 1: perfect inequality (only one item recommended)
```

Lower Gini = better long-tail coverage = fairer to all items.

**Novelty (Item Popularity Inverse):**
```
Novelty@K = (1/K) × Σ_i=1^K -log₂(popularity(i))
```

Higher novelty = recommending less-popular items (avoids echo chamber).

**Implementation:**
```rust
// src/recommend/metrics.rs

/// Serendipity: relevant but unexpected recommendations [19].
pub fn serendipity_at_k(
    recommended: &[String],
    relevant: &HashSet<String>,
    user_history: &[String],
    similarity_fn: impl Fn(&str, &str) -> f64,
    k: usize,
) -> f64;

/// Gini coefficient for recommendation distribution fairness.
pub fn gini_coefficient(item_counts: &HashMap<String, usize>) -> f64;

/// Novelty: inverse popularity of recommendations.
pub fn novelty_at_k(
    recommended: &[String],
    item_popularity: &HashMap<String, f64>,
    k: usize,
) -> f64;
```

### 9.4 Explainability Metrics (LIME)

**Toyota Way Critique:** Simple feature overlap explanations are tautological ("recommended because similar"). Use LIME for causal explanations [20].

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):**

LIME explains *why* a specific item was recommended by perturbing input features and observing output changes [20].

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate N perturbed samples around the query item
2. Get recommender predictions for each perturbation
3. Fit a simple linear model (interpretable) locally
4. Extract feature importances from linear model

**Implementation:**
```rust
// src/recommend/explainability.rs
use crate::explain::lime::LIME;

/// LIME explainer for recommendation systems [20].
pub struct RecommendationExplainer {
    /// LIME instance
    lime: LIME,
    /// Number of perturbations
    n_samples: usize,
}

impl RecommendationExplainer {
    /// Explain why item was recommended.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// Top-k features with importance scores (+ = increases score, - = decreases)
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// "We recommended 'Red Running Shoes' because:
    ///   +0.45: tag='running' (you viewed similar)
    ///   +0.32: brand='Nike' (you prefer this brand)
    ///   -0.12: price=$120 (slightly above your budget)"
    pub fn explain(
        &self,
        recommender: &dyn Recommender,
        item_id: &str,
        user_context: &UserContext,
        k_features: usize,
    ) -> Vec<(String, f64)>;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Trust: User understands *why* recommendation was made
- ✅ Debugging: Developers identify biased features
- ✅ Compliance: GDPR "right to explanation"
