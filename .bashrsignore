# bashrs ignore configuration for aprender
# See: https://github.com/paiml/bashrs

# Ignore rules with documented justifications:

# DET002: Non-deterministic timestamp usage
# Justification: Timestamps are intentionally used for unique baseline filenames
# in benchmark scripts. This is expected behavior, not a bug.
DET002

# SEC010: Path traversal risk in mkdir
# Justification: Paths in our scripts are hardcoded constants, not user input.
# Path traversal is not a risk when the path is a literal string.
SEC010

# SC2032: Variable assigned in script with shebang
# Justification: These are standalone scripts, not meant to be sourced.
# Variables are intentionally local to the script.
SC2032

# SC2117/SC2317: Unreachable code warnings
# Justification: These are false positives in case statements where
# exit/return is followed by ;; and esac - bashrs incorrectly flags
# the closing syntax as unreachable.
SC2117
SC2317

# MAKE010: Command missing error handling
# Justification: Some commands intentionally use || echo for graceful
# fallback messages (e.g., pmat not found). Fixed where appropriate.
# Remaining instances are intentional fallbacks.
MAKE010

# MAKE012: Recursive make invocation
# Justification: Recursive make is used for sub-targets like chaos-test-lite.
# While "Recursive Make Considered Harmful" is valid for large projects,
# our use case is simple delegation to a fallback target.
