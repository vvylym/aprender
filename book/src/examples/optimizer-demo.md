# Optimizer Demonstration

📝 **This chapter is under construction.**

This case study demonstrates SGD and Adam optimizers for gradient-based
optimization, following EXTREME TDD principles.

**Topics covered:**
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Momentum optimization
- Adam optimizer (adaptive learning rates)
- Loss function comparison (MSE, MAE, Huber)
